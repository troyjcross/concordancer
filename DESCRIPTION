Description: Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is a statistic 
  which measures the degree of agreement between two variables. The CCC is 
  useful for assessing (i) the measurement agreement between two variables 
  (typically outputs between two devices); (ii) the reproducibility between 
  two measurements obtained from the same device; and (iii) inter-rater 
  reliability. The 'concordancer' package provides a 'C++' implementation of 
  Lin's CCC via 'Rcpp'. In so doing, the ccc() function contained herein is 
  a much faster implementation than those contained in other R packages. For
  more details on Lin's CCC, please see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_correlation_coefficient>.
